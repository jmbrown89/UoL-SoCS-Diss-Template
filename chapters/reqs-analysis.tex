Drawing upon the research you've conducted, this goal of this chapter is to formalise a set of requirements that project must fulfil in order to meet your objectives. This chapter can be relatively short, and reference the aim(s) \& objectives given at the end of the previous chapter. 

For software-oriented projects, consider key stakeholders (end-users, business owners) when analysing the requirements of your software. This may be through primary research (i.e., interviews with potential end-users or clients) or secondary research (e.g., literature review, survey of existing products). For research-oriented projects, use your literature survey to highlight current gaps in knowledge that you hope to address. Consider what your artefact must do in order to obtain meaningful results.
